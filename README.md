# Toy Ray Tracer

"Ray Tracing like it's 1993."

A project I wrote over a few evenings for a bit of fun, to impress the family, and to demonstrate to myself that I can still remember some 3D vector maths from university!

It attempts to emphasise readability of code over performance, and won't win any prizes for speed! "GPUs? We've heard of them."
